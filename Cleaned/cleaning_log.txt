## Tools & Formulas Used

### Google Sheets Formulas
```
1. Remove duplicates: =UNIQUE(range)
2. Fill missing values: =IFERROR(A2, AVERAGE($A$2:$A$1000))
3. Trim spaces: =TRIM(A2)
4. Uppercase: =UPPER(A2)
5. Date formatting: =TEXT(A2,"YYYY-MM-DD")
6. Remove special characters: =REGEXREPLACE(A2,"[^A-Za-z0-9 ]","")
7. Conditional replacement: =IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)
```

### Python Scripts (if used)
