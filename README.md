# 🔍 Los Angeles Crime Analytics (2020–2024)

A data-driven analytical project that transforms Los Angeles crime records into a structured, decision-ready dashboard and strategic report for public safety planning.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes LAPD crime data from **2020 to 2024** to uncover patterns in criminal activity across the city. The outcome is a practical decision-support system designed for LAPD planners, budget allocators, and community safety officers — operable with minimal technical overhead.

### Core Finding

> Crime in Los Angeles is **not randomly distributed** — it clusters predictably across specific areas, time windows, and crime types. Targeted, data-driven interventions in a small number of high-priority areas and time windows can produce substantially larger citywide safety improvements than broad, untargeted approaches.

---

## 🎯 Key Deliverables

- **Hotspot Zone Identification** — Geographic clusters of high crime activity
- **Dominant Crime Categories** — Top crime types by frequency and severity
- **Peak Crime Windows** — Time-of-day and day-of-week patterns
- **Case Closure Performance Analysis** — Gaps in investigation and resolution rates
- **Interactive Dashboard** — Visual decision-support interface
- **Analytical Report** — Strategy-ready findings and recommendations

## 💡 Conclusions & Impact

The analytical framework delivered in this project enables:

- **Targeted resource deployment** in identified high-crime zones
- **Time-based policing strategies** aligned with peak crime windows
- **Performance benchmarking** for case closure rates by precinct and crime type
- **Data-informed budget allocation** for community safety programs

By concentrating interventions on the highest-priority areas and time slots, stakeholders can achieve **maximum citywide safety impact** without proportionally increasing resource expenditure.
